# MARV-19
This repository is for the Multipurpose Aerial Research Vehicle, which is a high school STEM project. The purpose of this project is to make a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) with VTOL (verticle take-off and landing), which can conduct climate related research (atmosphereic pressure, photos, etc). This code repository will (hopefully) contain the code for MARV.
